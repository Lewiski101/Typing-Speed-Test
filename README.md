## Features

*   **Real-Time Typing Test**: A dedicated test page (`test.html`) with a 60-second timer and a dynamic paragraph loader.
*   **Continuous Typing Mode**: When a user successfully completes a paragraph before the timer runs out, a new paragraph is immediately loaded, allowing for uninterrupted practice.
*   **Dynamic Paragraphs**: Paragraphs are fetched from a `paragraphs.json` file, making it easy to add or modify the test content.
*   **Real-Time Feedback**: Users receive instant feedback on their Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy, and mistakes.
*   **Character Highlighting**: The application highlights correct and incorrect characters as the user types.
*   **Paste Prevention**: Users are prevented from pasting text into the input field to ensure genuine typing practice.
*   **Comprehensive Blog**: 15 SEO-optimized blog posts covering a wide range of topics, from typing tutorials and keyboarding basics to ergonomics and health tips.
*   **SEO and AdSense Ready**: The project includes a `robots.txt`, `ads.txt`, a `favicon`, and meta tags for description and keywords to improve search engine visibility and prepare for ad monetization.
*   **Legal Pages**: Standard `terms.html` and `privacy.html` pages are included.
*   **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the web pages.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: For a utility-first approach to styling and creating a responsive design.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For the core application logic, including the typing test, real-time updates, and dynamic content loading.
